# Project Title: Instacart Data Analysis

Overview:
Welcome to the Instacart Data Analysis project! This repository contains code and resources to explore and analyze data from Instacart, focusing on answering specific questions related to customer behavior and item preferences. The analysis aims to provide insights into customer shopping habits, reorder patterns, and the top items added to carts.

Contents:

data: This directory holds the datasets used for the analysis.

orders.csv: Dataset containing order information, including customer IDs and order IDs.
order_products.csv: Dataset containing product details for each order, including product IDs, reorder status, and more.
products.csv: Dataset containing information about the products.
notebooks: This directory includes Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

InstacartOrder - CookieCrumbsinData.ipynb: Notebook detailing the data cleaning and preprocessing steps. Notebook containing the analysis of customer behavior and item preferences. Notebook showcasing visualizations of the analysis results.

README.md: The main documentation file for the project, providing a summary of the analysis and instructions for replication.

Project Workflow:

Data Preprocessing:

Load and clean the provided datasets.
Merge relevant information to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
Handle missing values and format data as needed.
Analysis:

Calculate the average number of items in one order and visualize the distribution.
Identify the top 20 items that are reordered most frequently.
Calculate the reorder proportion for each product and customer.
Determine the top 20 items that are added first to carts.
Visualization:

Create visualizations to convey the findings effectively.
Generate charts, graphs, and tables to visualize item distribution, reorder patterns, and other insights.
Conclusion:

Summarize the key findings related to customer behavior and preferences.
Discuss implications and potential strategies for Instacart based on the analysis.
